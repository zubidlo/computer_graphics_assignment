Project: Computer Graphics Assignment using jogl 2.0 interface to OpenGl.

These programs work only on 64bit Microsoft Windows and 64bit JVM
because the jogl 2.0 library given to me is 64bit with windows dlls.
Source code is compiled with JDK 1.7 with jogl 2.0 dependencies.
jogl 2.0 + documentation is in libs/ folder

Assignment can be compiler and run by "run_assignment.bat"
